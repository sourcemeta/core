JSONToolkit
===========

JSON is not supported in the C++ standard library. As a consequence, consuming
a C++ library that uses JSON also means adopting their JSON implementation of
choice. Otherwise, you would need to write (often inefficient) code to make
multiple JSON implementations work together.

To solve this problem, JSONToolkit aims to be a thin interoperable frontend to
multiple JSON implementations.
