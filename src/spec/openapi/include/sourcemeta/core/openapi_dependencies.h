/// reported after the references of every document read in between, and not at
/// all where it ends analysis instead. A reference that names the document it
/// sits in is that document's own business rather than a dependency, and is
/// reported nowhere. An official JSON Schema dialect is reported where a
/// reference names one and left out where a dialect declaration does, and
/// neither is read.
///
/// Analysis throws where it cannot go on, which is wherever the span turns out
/// not to describe one API: a reference nothing answers for, a document that
/// cannot be read as what reached it, or more locations than the allowance
/// permits. Returns what it registered against that allowance, which falls
/// short of what a second run needs wherever a schema walk raised and another
/// document answered for it afterwards.
